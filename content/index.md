title: "About me"
---

I'm Bruno Croci, a professional video game programmer and artist. I like to photographing, producing music and drawing. So far, most of this website consists of old photographies and music I made for some video games. Only recently I opened myself to an artistic side, so I went and created [flingern](https://github.com/CrociDB/flingern), a static website generator to make this website and start sharing my artistic journey.

Check my [Photo Gallery](/photography/) and my [Video Game Music](/vgmusic/).
