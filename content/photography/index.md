Here are some of my photos. I usually take a camera with me wherever I go, so I can photograph just about anything I think can be nice.

For the last few years, I've been playing more with analog. Got myself into the rabbit hole of old analog cameras and bought a few 35mm SLRs, rangefinders and point-and-shoots and a couple medium formats too. I did some development, but only black and white.

In this gallery, there will be digital photos taken with my mirrorless and some old digicam, 35mm analog and medium format photos. Before I'd usually indicate which one is which, but I guess that's not very important.
