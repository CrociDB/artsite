Arte Xavega is a centuries-old, traditional fishing technique practiced in Portugal. In Praia da Torreira, this practice continues daily, drawing the attention of curious visitors who gather to witness tractors hauling in the fishing nets. The process is marked by a long anticipation, as the contents of the nets remain unknown until they are brought ashore. While the catch may sometimes yield an abundance of fish, at other times it includes smaller, unwanted species that are discarded back into the sea, often dead. This, in turn, attracts a large flock of seagulls, which emerge as the true beneficiaries of this enduring spectacle.

Those photos were made with an experimental camera which its sensor's infra-red and ultra-violed filter was removed. That's why so many vibrant colors and often awkward colors.
